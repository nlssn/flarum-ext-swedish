## Thanks
A big thanks to [@acarlsson](https://github.com/acarlsson) who created [the first Swedish language extension](https://github.com/acarlsson/flarum-ext-swedish) for Flarum. A lot of the initial translations came from that project. Some things were changed, more has been (and will continue to be) added. Again, thank you!
